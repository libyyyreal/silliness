# silliness
silliness is a Mod Menu for Gorilla Tag, striving to be the absolute silliest, stupidest, absolutely diabolical menu out there.
It also serves as a learning experience for me, due to me not knowing much C#, this helps me learn more about it alongside learning about coding in general.

# Installation

- Download the menu from the discord at `https://discord.gg/Cnky4TydaU`, or you can go download it from the `releases` page in the github repository.
- Once downloaded, drag and drop it into your `plugins` folder in bepinex.
- Load up the game and the menu should be there!
